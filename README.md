#DoukutsuEdit

Simple Cave Story map and tileset editor

##Compiling

Firstly, you need:

- A C++17 capable compiler
- SDL2

Then if you clone the repo and type `make`, it should JustWork(tm).

##Features

- View and edit PXM, PXE, TSC, and PXA files

##Why should I use this?

You shouldn't, unless you are trying to mod my port, which you also should not do.
It'll certainly work on the PC version, but will lack features such as editing stuff in the EXE or npc.tbl.
For stuff like that, there is already Booster's Lab and Cave Editor.

I had 2 reasons for making this:

- Something I can use to quickly inspect/edit Cave Story maps without needing to copy back and forth between the PC version
- Learning to use Dear ImGui
